\chapter{Introduction}
The \btitle book is a netbook expansion for the \dandd Roleplaying Game. It is
primarily a nonplayer resource focusing on new options and expanded rules for
D\&D nonplayers who want to create or advance noobs.

\section{Noobs}
Everyone recognizes the Noob. The people filling the town market and giving it
an appropriately urban atmosphere are noobs. The goblins living in the lost
temple just over that hill are probably noobs; the guy cleaning glasses behind
the bar almost certainly is. The distinguishing characteristic of Noobs is their
role: Noobs function as scenery, rather than combat threats or challenges of
skill. As such, Noobs are almost invariably vastly less powerful than PCs or
even non-Noob NPCs, and tend to die en masse whenever real power is present.

\subsection{Why Noobs?}
Given that Noobs fill no interesting function, why do they exist at all? The
answer lies in their vast numbers. The individual Noob is useless, but together,
they vastly outnumber all the non-Noobs in the world put together. Noobs are
responsible for mundane things like growing crops, producing equipment,
defending towns against monsters when non-Noobs are not present, trading goods,
and so on. Quite simply, without Noobs, there would be no food production, and
no towns, and therefore no inns; without inns, there is no place for a party of
PCs to meet for the first time and decide to adventure, and there is no location
for a non-Noob NPC to meet said PCs and enlist them for a dangerous but
potentially lucrative quest.

Noobiness is a recessive genetic trait - many a powerful PC or NPC was born to
Noob parents, but Noob children are rarely born to non-Noob parents. A peculiar
form of 'reverse inheritance' is currently under study among prominent
Noobologists: when a non-Noob is born to Noob parents, said parents appear to
begin losing some of their Noob traits. This effect is especially pronounced
when the child is a PC.

\subsection{Non-Noobs}
Non-Noobs are PCs, powerful NPCs, and high-level monsters. Non-Noobs tend to be
adventurers, rulers, and military leaders. Non-Noobs occasionally appear in the
guise of Noobs; this most frequently occurs in places of commerce and in inns.
There is a strong statistical correlation between non-Noobs stealing for fun and
profit (as opposed to out of necessity) and the sudden and unexpected appearance
of equal and opposite non-Noobs in certain worlds. This phenomenon is known as
"karmic rebalancing". In general, while non-Noobs are in the driver's seat,
without the Noobs, there would be no cart and no horses.

For more detail about non-Noobs, consult The \textit{Complete Motherfucker}
Handbook.

\chapter{Expanded Classes}
This chapter presents alternate classes for each of the NPC classes given in the
\textit{Dungeon Master's Guide}. These classes are designed to give a different
flavor to Noobs (figuratively, for the benefit of PCs, and literally, for the
benefit of dragons), as well as make them more suitable for certain roles.

\subsection{Attuned}
The Attuned is a spontaneous spellcaster, like the sorceror, but without the
deeply ingrained command over magical energies that the sorceror wields, nor the
sheer charisma to truly bend magic to her will. However, the Attuned does have
a small degree of arcane power, and can thus wield a small selection of spells.
\\
\textbf{Hit Die:} d6. \\
The Attuned's class skills are: Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge
(any) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int). \\
\textbf{Skill Points per Level}: 2.

\subsubsection{Class Features}
All of the following are class features of the Attuned class. \\
\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} Attuned are skilled with all simple
weapons. Attuned are not proficient with any kinds of armor or shields. \\
\textbf{Spells:} An Attuned casts arcane spells (the same type as available to
the sorceror and wizard) drawn from the list given below. An Attuned need not
prepare her spells in advance, and may cast any spell from her class list
spontaneously. The key statistic of an Attuned for spellcasting is Int. \\
\textbf{Scribe Scroll:} At 3rd level, an Attuned gains the Scribe Scroll feat
for free. \\
\textbf{Arcane Learning:} At 5th level, an Attuned may add a single spell of any
level she can cast from the Sorceror/Wizard list to her list of spells. For
example, a 5th level Attuned could add Invisiblity (level 2) to her list, but could not
add Fly (level 3). At 10th level, she may add an additional spell of up to 3rd
level from the Sorceror/Wizard list. At 15th level, she may add an additional
spell of up to 4th level from the Sorceror/Wizard list. \\
\textbf{Arcane Mastery:} At 20th level, an Attuned may add any two spells from
the Sorceror/Wizard list of up to 5th level to her list.
