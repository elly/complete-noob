\chapter{Introduction}
The \btitle book is a netbook expansion for the \dandd Roleplaying Game. It is
primarily a nonplayer resource focusing on new options and expanded rules for
D\&D nonplayers who want to create or advance noobs.

\section{Noobs}
Everyone recognizes the Noob. The people filling the town market and giving it
an appropriately urban atmosphere are noobs. The goblins living in the lost
temple just over that hill are probably noobs; the guy cleaning glasses behind
the bar almost certainly is. The distinguishing characteristic of Noobs is their
role: Noobs function as scenery, rather than combat threats or challenges of
skill. As such, Noobs are almost invariably vastly less powerful than PCs or
even non-Noob NPCs, and tend to die en masse whenever real power is present.

\subsection{Why Noobs?}
Given that Noobs fill no interesting function, why do they exist at all? The
answer lies in their vast numbers. The individual Noob is useless, but together,
they vastly outnumber all the non-Noobs in the world put together. Noobs are
responsible for mundane things like growing crops, producing equipment,
defending towns against monsters when non-Noobs are not present, trading goods,
and so on. Quite simply, without Noobs, there would be no food production, and
no towns, and therefore no inns; without inns, there is no place for a party of
PCs to meet for the first time and decide to adventure, and there is no location
for a non-Noob NPC to meet said PCs and enlist them for a dangerous but
potentially lucrative quest.

Noobiness is a recessive genetic trait - many a powerful PC or NPC was born to
Noob parents, but Noob children are rarely born to non-Noob parents. A peculiar
form of 'reverse inheritance' is currently under study among prominent
Noobologists: when a non-Noob is born to Noob parents, said parents appear to
begin losing some of their Noob traits. This effect is especially pronounced
when the child is a PC.

\subsection{Non-Noobs}
Non-Noobs are PCs, powerful NPCs, and high-level monsters. Non-Noobs tend to be
adventurers, rulers, and military leaders. Non-Noobs occasionally appear in the
guise of Noobs; this most frequently occurs in places of commerce and in inns.
There is a strong statistical correlation between non-Noobs stealing for fun and
profit (as opposed to out of necessity) and the sudden and unexpected appearance
of equal and opposite non-Noobs in certain worlds. This phenomenon is known as
"karmic rebalancing". In general, while non-Noobs are in the driver's seat,
without the Noobs, there would be no cart and no horses.
